Wait for player initialisation (queue a track if not initialised yet) (set global state variable when ready and poll for it if not ready)

Convert all this shitty code to client side... like a proper react app:
- remove cookies / window / any other dodginess

Utilise next js routes now that most of the fetching is done from client side
- will hide spotify credentials


client side move;
- move use3d to menu bar, add to context
- move player initialisation to layout
