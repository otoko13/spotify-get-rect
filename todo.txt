- remember to initialise use3d state from cookie

- Add current device and name to a new current player context (don't think we need this actually) Update that when polling

OK now for when polling, keep polling but start by relying only on the polling to update the track info. And set device in context if it's changed

Then add in the player events to set the track immediately . And the device. And see what happens. Maybe still keep the code that compares the device to this device, and does nothing if they don't match, however this could lead to locking out any changes if there's a race condition with another interval that completes out of order

Maybe put current track on context as well? For the babylon highlighting.
