- using middleware to get the pathname in server side components. We use this when refreshing the token,
passing the path to the refresh token "api" page where it can then redirect directly back to that path after
getting new auth.

- for login, we can't pass the path to the redirect URI for spotify (the URL you set in the app settings need
to exactly match). Instead we forward to a login client component where we can set the path in localstorage,
check for this on the home page and do the forward.
